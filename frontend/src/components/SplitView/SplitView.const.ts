    Part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, Curiosity, was the largest and most capable rover ever sent to Mars when it launched in 2011.
    Curiosity set out to answer the question: Did Mars ever have the right environmental conditions to support small life forms called microbes? 
    Early in its mission, Curiosity's scientific tools found chemical and mineral evidence of past habitable environments on Mars.
     It continues to explore the rock record from a time when Mars could have been home to microbial life.

    The Opportunity rover searched for ancient water on Mars, and found evidence that the Red Planet once had a period when it was wet enough,
    for long enough, that it could have sustained microbial life. The rover's original 90-day mission became an extraordinary 15 years,
    until the rover finally succumbed to a dust storm.

    The Spirit and Opportunity rovers together represented NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER), part of the Mars Exploration Program.
    Launched about a month apart in 2003, the twin roversâ€™ main scientific objective was to search for a range of rocks and soil types and
    then look for clues for past water activity on Mars.
